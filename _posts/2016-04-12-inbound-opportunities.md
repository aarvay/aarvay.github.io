title: "Untimely Inbound Opportunities"

  How do you deal with nice stuff coming your way when you're too busy to
  give a fuck about it?

Squandering may be a harsh word, but sometimes you are, by some virtue, *forced*
with an opportunity that you couldn't focus diligently on, and as a result, you
either lose it or not end up making the best of it. The most important
characteristic of it is that, it's something you are looking out for,
but just not now. This is the type of opportunity that I call the
**untimely inbound opportunity**.

It could be anything. Your favorite artist coming to your town when you're
away on a holiday, an introduction to someone that you are looking for but not
too soon, or a meeting set up with a potential investor for your startup when
you're working hard to push the product to more users. Anything. It happens to
everyone. At least a few times. If you've never faced this, you ought to meet
more nice people in your life. Seriously.

Anyways, it did happen to me a couple of times and made me feel worse at
times. If David Gilmour was here in Chennai and I wasn't, I would've just
probably killed myself and pretty much couldn't have done anything else. Unless
that happens, depending on what's coming your way, you could either:

- Say "No". It's hard to do this, especially for a great opportunity, but trust
me, it would be better to avoid it totally than get bogged down by how it turned
out to be. In worst situations, it could even give you false negative signs
about what you're doing and unnecessarily distract you from your core focus.
Be nice when you decline and stress heavily on the fact that you'll definitely
be reaching out at the right time.

- Find a way to push it to the right time. This has rarely happened in my case.
The other worst characteristic of UIOs are they feel like a time bomb thrown at
you. But in some cases, you could find your way to push it to the right time.
Ideally try to do this before anything.

- Take the opportunity, if you're sure that you can convey the fact that you're
there right now only because it came your way and did not want to miss it. This
would cover you up from not looking like you were squandering.

- Finally you're not going to miss it anyway, if you know you can already
handle it.
