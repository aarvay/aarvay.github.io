  My latest homepage iteration turns it into a logfile
---

Welcome to my **web-log**. The *'blog'* abbreviation quite didn't work well
for me because somehow it hardwired me to think of it as a place where I put
some effort to write a "post". Most of the times, I just keep thinking of what
to post. As a result I *never get to actually post* anything.

This is the latest iteration of my homepage/blog. I'm *restarting* and have
decided to go back to the roots and look at it like logs - timestamped, thoughts,
or incidents, that occur to me as is. That's all. I don't have to think of what to
post, I just log what I thought/did. I hope there're no more major iterations
and I continue to log actively.

This is the first log. Several more to come, streaming!

Happy logging to myself.
