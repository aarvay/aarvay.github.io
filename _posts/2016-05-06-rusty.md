title: "Getting Rusty"
excerpt: >
  What have you been doing lately?

We're worse than "Iron" in some sense. I mean, it takes just a bit of *treading
tangentially*, for us to get "rusty". If you ask yourself "What have you been
doing lately?" and get a little alarmed, it probably means you've started to
rust already.

Inefficiency, less productivity, more procrastinations, and general feeling that
nothing's right are symptoms of getting rusty. They can take you quite far away
from where you're supposed to be.

Don't get rusty. Always be up to something worthwhile. Feel good. Stop drifting
away.
